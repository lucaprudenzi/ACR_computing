Hypatia of Alexandria (b.(350?)370, d.415)
==========================================

**Note: This is about the ancient Greek mathematician, not the** `Journal of Feminist Philosophy <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15272001>`_.

Although the name of `Hypatia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia>`_ of Alexandria is pronounced (very) differently in `various languages <https://viaf.org/viaf/316731617>`_, we are supposed to use the (`Hellenistic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek>`_, or `Koine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek>`_) Greek pronunciation, which emphasizes the "i" (`Ὑπατία <https://translate.google.com/?sl=el&tl=de&text=%CE%A5%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%AF%CE%B1&op=translate>`_). See also the discussion `here <https://www.math.uh.edu/information/ypatia/index.html>`_.

There is a detailed discussion of the setting in `this paper <http://jnsilva.ludicum.org/Sherlock/hypatia3.pdf>`_ (`local copy <https://hypatia.aei.mpg.de/images/hypatia3.pdf>`_) which also gives some hints why and to what extent the `movie "Agora" <https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1186830>`_ is wrong/historically incorrect. (On IMDb, there's also an extensive list of "goofs".)

`Two <http://jnsilva.ludicum.org/Sherlock/hypatia1.pdf>`_ `more <http://jnsilva.ludicum.org/Sherlock/hypatia2.pdf>`_ articles and their `local <https://hypatia.aei.mpg.de/images/hypatia1.pdf>`_ `copies <https://hypatia.aei.mpg.de/images/hypatia2.pdf>`_, there's even more `here on JStor <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2975600?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents>`_ (access may be limited).

I have collected a number of images, although none of them is authentic - photography obviously wasn't invented yet, and most documents about her are lost.
